        Since the eSports industry is fully digitized, 
        big data makes it possible to obtain and analyze metrics from all available matches. 
        Weâ€™ve developed an in-house data processing and cleaning methodology (Data Mining), 
        which transforms statistical events into features for our machine learning prediction model. 
        All events are developed by professional CS:GO coaches.
